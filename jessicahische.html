  <p> Jessica Hische among many things is a letterer, illustrator and type designer originally from America. Hisch graduated from the Tyler School of Art with a degree in Graphic and Interactive Design. During her life as a designer she has managed to accomplish many things and gain experience along the way. After graduating Hische almost immediately began working as an intern for design company ‘Headcase Design’ in Philadelphia. A short time after this, Hische then moved on to become a Senior Designer at Louise Fili Ltd. Louise Fili Ltd is an award-winning New York based graphic and digital design company which specialise in designing strategic brand development and packaging for speciality food products for popular clients and well-known restaurants. After working at Louise Fili Ltd for two and a half years, Hische decided the best option for her was to leave and focus on furthering her career. Currently, Jessica is based in California where she has a studio with lettering artist Erik Marinovich. </p>

  <p> After leaving her job at Louise Fili Ltd Hische wanted to continue lettering once a day for her personal portfolio and so began a project called ‘Daily Drop Cap’. It was this specific project that I had previously heard of and so was interested to learn more about Jessica Hische and her journey so far in her design career. The project consisted of an illustrated letter being released each day in order of the alphabet. The project continued for 12 repeats of the alphabet and users were and still are able to download the letters freely to use on personal sites and blogs. The project included many themes of lettering such as botanical, circus, script and retro and showed a wide range of skill and imagination from Hische. The project was originally set up to keep Hische motivated within her freelance career however it received a large amount of press online resulting in a lot of recognition for the designer and therefore serving as a brilliant start to her career. A quote from Hische rounds this project up perfectly, </p>
    <blockquote> “The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.” <cite> (Quotes on Design, 2019) </cite> </blockquote>

<p> Jessica Hische has created another personal project named ‘Should I Work For Free’ which she designed as a flow chart to help other designers decide if they should work for free, or more so convincing them not to work for free. The flow chart was created entirely using HTML and CSS and shows the talent that Hische has to offer. I think that Hische is such an inspirational woman as she not only creates impressive design work but also strives to help others along the way. Similar to this project, Hische has created a range of customisable email templates which can be used to respond politely but firmly to any company asking for very low or unpaid design work. It is important for people like Jessica Hische to speak out about this within the design industry as often designers are at risk of being taken advantage of and carrying out large amounts of work with little money to show for it at the end of the project. </p>

<p> In 2015 Hische released her first book titled ‘In Progress’. This book gives an insight into Hische’s sketchbook and shows the process of designing from pencil to vector images. I think that this a great insight for other artists to enable them to understand the ins and outs of what it takes to design something for a brand. I think that Jessica Hische is a very inspiring designer in the way that she uses her work as a way of helping others. Hische has recently released two children’s picture books titled ‘Tomorrow I’ll be Kind’ and ‘Tomorrow I’ll Be Brave’ which is currently available for pre order. The books are a wonderful display of typography and design yet also aim to encourage kids to be “grateful, helpful, and kind.” (PenguinRandomhouse.com, 2019) <p>

<p> Furthermore, Hische is not just an illustrator and typographer but is also very intelligent when it comes to web design. Working alongside Russ Maschmeyer, Jessica Hische created a website especially for teaching non-web designers how to use HTML and CSS effectively. The website consists of a series of web tutorial videos which aims to simplify the idea of coding and allow it to be accessible and usable for all. Along with this side project Hische created another humorous project titled This is how twitter works Mom’ where she created a website for the simple purpose of teaching her Mother how to use Twitter. Hische is continuously using her knowledge and creative thinking to inspire up and coming designers of today. I admire Hische as a designer as I think that she uses her platform excellently, in a way to design yet at the same time help others. </p>

Procrasti-working is described as ‘any work you do to avoid working on what really matters’. Hische came up with this term as an explanation for the work that she creates on the side whilst creating client’s work. I think that the idea of ‘procrasti-working’ is very inventive and useful. The work that we designers create when procrastinating is normally not put to any use whereas Jessica Hische has shown that this work can sometimes be very interesting to others, for example her ‘Daily Drop Cap’ project is now what Hische is known for as it became so popular. Hische has a theory that the things that are done when procrastinating are what that person should be designing at all times, as that is what is enjoyed the most. </p>
