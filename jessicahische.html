  <p> Jessica Hische among many things is a letterer, illustrator and type designer originally from America. Hische graduated from the Tyler School of Art with a degree in Graphic and Interactive Design. During her life as a designer she has managed to accomplish many things and gain experience along the way. After graduating Hische almost immediately began working as an intern for design company ‘Headcase Design’ in Philadelphia. A short time after this, Hische then moved on to become a Senior Designer at Louise Fili Ltd. Louise Fili Ltd is an award-winning New York based graphic and digital design company which specialise in designing strategic brand development and packaging for speciality food products for popular clients and well-known restaurants. After working at Louise Fili Ltd for two and a half years, Hische decided the best option for her was to leave and focus on furthering her career. Currently, Jessica is based in California where she has a studio with lettering artist Erik Marinovich.  </p>

  <p> After leaving her job at Louise Fili Ltd Hische wanted to continue lettering once a day for her personal portfolio and so began a project called ‘Daily Drop Cap’. It was this specific project that I had previously heard of and so was interested to learn more about Jessica Hische and her journey so far in her design career. The project consisted of an illustrated letter being released each day in order of the alphabet. The project continued for 12 repeats of the alphabet and users were and still are able to download the letters freely to use on personal sites and blogs. The project included many themes of lettering such as botanical, circus, script and retro and showed a wide range of skill and imagination from Hische.

<p>
    The project was originally set up to keep Hische motivated within her freelance career however it received a large amount of press online resulting in a lot of recognition for the designer, therefore serving as a brilliant start to her career. A quote from Hische rounds this project up perfectly,  </p>
    <blockquote> “The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.” <cite> (Quotes on Design, 2019) </cite> </blockquote>

<p> Jessica Hische has since had a successful career and inspired other creators with her numerous projects. A personal project named ‘Should I Work For Free’ was designed as a flow chart to help other designers decide if they should work for free, or more so convincing them not to work for free. The flow chart was created entirely using HTML and CSS and shows the talent that Hische has to offer. </p>

  I think that Hische is such an inspirational woman as she not only creates impressive design work but also strives to help others with her creative processes. Similar to this project, Hische has created a range of customisable email templates which can be used to respond politely but firmly to any company asking for very low or unpaid design work. It is important for people like Jessica Hische to speak out about this within the design industry as often designers are at risk of being taken advantage of and carrying out large amounts of work with little money to show for it at the end of the project.  </p>

<p> In 2015 Hische released her first book titled ‘In Progress’. This book gives an insight into Hische’s sketchbook and also shows the process of designing from pencil to vector images. The book includes sketches and useful resources to show how the creative thinking process leads to successful designs. I think that this a great insight for other artists to enable them to understand the ins and outs of what it takes to design something for a brand and to do it well. I think that Jessica Hische is a very inspiring designer in the way that she uses her work as a way of helping others who may be just starting out in their freelance careers. Hische has recently released two children’s picture books titled ‘Tomorrow I’ll be Kind’ and ‘Tomorrow I’ll Be Brave’ which is currently available for pre order. The books are a wonderful display of typography and design yet also aim to encourage kids to be “grateful, helpful, and kind.” (PenguinRandomhouse.com, 2019) <p>

<p> Furthermore, Hische is not just an illustrator and typographer but is also very intelligent when it comes to web design. Working alongside Russ Maschmeyer, Jessica Hische created a website especially for teaching non-web designers how to use HTML and CSS effectively. The website consists of a series of web tutorial videos which aims to simplify the idea of coding and allow it to be accessible and usable for all.  The website was very successful, and many articles have rated it as one of the best places to study web development from scratch on. </p>

<p>  Along with this side project Hische created another humorous project titled ‘This is how twitter works Mom’ where she created a website for the simple purpose of teaching her Mother how to use Twitter. Hische is continuously using her knowledge and creative thinking to inspire up and coming designers of today. I admire Hische as a designer as I think that she uses her platform excellently, in a way to design and through this to help others.  </p>

Procrasti-working is described as “any work you do to avoid working on what really matters” (Boag,2012). Hische came up with this term as an explanation for the work that she creates on the side-lines whilst completing work for clients. I think that the idea of ‘procrasti-working’ is very inventive and useful. The work that we designers create when procrastinating is normally not put to any use, whereas Jessica Hische has shown that the work created in this headspace can sometimes be very interesting to others, for example her ‘Daily Drop Cap’ project is now what Hische is known due to its popularity within the design community.

 <p> Hische has a theory that the things that are done when procrastinating are what that person should be designing at all times, as that is what is enjoyed the most. Jessica Hische has explained in the past that her side projects are strictly kept as ‘side projects’ so that they continue to be a hobbie and enjoyable process for her that are unpaid. Upon listening to a talk by Hische for Github, I learned that she delved into graphic design as it was the work that she was most drawn to completing whilst procrastinating during a fine art course at the time. Hische has inspired me to focus on the things that I enjoy doing such as lettering or illustration, and always incorporate this into my design work as this is how you will be identified as a designer. Hische inspires designers to find what their forte is and to embrace this and use it within their design work in order to be noticed for doing what you love. </p>
<p> An example of this technique working is in the ‘Daily Drop Cap’ project. Initially this was a side project launched to ensure Hische would continue to do lettering after leaving her job and becoming a freelancer. As a result of this exercise, numerous other projects came about because of it such as a collection of ‘drop caps’ with Penguin whereby Hische created an A-Z series of lettering style book covers based on the authors last name. I think that this proves that the ‘procrasti-working’ approach is actually a very practical way of working.  </p>

  Jessica Hische has created huge success for herself so far in her career through her design work such as lettering art, books, talks and side projects. I have found her to be an interesting person to research due to the diversity and uniqueness of the work that she manages to produce. Hische uses her knowledge that she has gained along the way to encourage and teach others, whether this be through design projects or by attending conferences and partaking in public speaking events. The following quote from Jessica Hische stood out to me as it is very prominent advice for new up-and-coming designers,
<blockquote> “Every new thing you make will be (should be) the nicest thing you’ve made so far, because you’re learning and getting better with each and every new project.” <cite> (Budrick,2017)</cite> </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I think that this quote is very relevant for designers as it is so true, you should always strive to achieve bigger and better things with each new project that is created. I think that as designers we learn through doing and as a result design is continually changing, improving and becoming more refined. Jessica Hische inspires creative designers of today as she is an educator as well as a designer. Hische creates beautiful work but at the same time uses this as a means of tools for learning and as a result is able to inspire designers of all kinds in today’s society.
